# React Native Wrap Balancer
 - A Simple React Native Component Making Titles More Readable

## Introduction


Inspired by [react-wrap-balancer](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app/), react-native-wrap-balancer is a simple React Native Component that makes your titles more readable in different viewport sizes. 
It improves the wrapping to avoid situations like a single word in the last line, making the content more “balanced”.
